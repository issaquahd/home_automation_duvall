# home_automation_duvall

Musings of migrating from Google Home to Home Assistant. I am a bit in awe that Lucid Charts or the likes doesn't have std home automation templates. Or even a Lucidscale that could help port iftt statements into working JSON/YAML for API calls. 

In the meantime, I have used Lucid Charts to record the current state of home automation as a visual reference. I hope to put some serious thought into this and productize it. Clear lines, colors and layers representing Zybee and ZWave with Matter, etc.
